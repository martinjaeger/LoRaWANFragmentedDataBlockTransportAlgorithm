# LoRaWAN Fragmented Data Block Transport Algorithm Implementation in C

This library implements forward error correction algorithm of `LoRaWAN Fragmented Data Block Transport Specification v1.0.0`.

## Compile

### Codeblocks

The library contains a [Codeblocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/) project. You could download Codeblocks from its official website to compile and run the test example.

### With CMake

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
cat input.bin | ./frag_decoder
```

## History

The original implementation is provided by ARMmbed or Semtech in below mentioned link. I rewrite the code in C (Originally provided in C++). The optimization is to use bitmap instead of buffer to reduce memory cost, and of course it will run slower than the ARMmbed or Semtech library.
